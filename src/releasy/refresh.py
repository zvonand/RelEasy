"""``releasy refresh`` — keep already-tracked rebase PRs current.

This is a strict maintenance loop. It does **not** create new branches,
discover new source PRs, or open new pull requests. It only walks the
PRs RelEasy is already tracking in its state file and tries to refresh
each one against the latest target branch.

After ``releasy run`` opens a batch of rebase PRs, the target branch
(``origin/<base_branch>``) keeps moving as other work lands. Some PRs
will eventually conflict with the new tip even though they were clean
when first opened. That's what this command exists for:

1. Iterate every tracked PR (entries in ``state.features`` that have a
   ``rebase_pr_url`` and a live ``branch_name``). No discovery, no new
   entries, no new PRs.
2. Fetch the latest tips of the target branch and the PR branch from
   origin (so we don't operate on a stale local copy).
3. Attempt ``git merge --no-ff origin/<base_branch>`` into the PR branch.
   - Clean merge → leave the PR alone (we only act on conflicts).
   - Conflict → invoke the same AI resolver used for cherry-picks (with
     the merge-flavoured prompt) and, on success, push the resolved
     merge commit to the PR branch (status preserved).
   - AI gives up / disabled → abort the merge, reset the local branch
     back to its original tip, and mark the entry as ``conflict`` in
     state + project board.

The AI resolver invocation is shared with the cherry-pick path
(``ai_resolve.attempt_ai_resolve``) so prompt rendering, claude
subprocess management, postcondition verification, and worktree cleanup
all behave identically; only the prompt template (``merge_prompt_file``)
and the in-progress operation differ.
