"""``releasy address-review`` — let the AI address PR review feedback.

Given a pull-request URL, this module:

1. Fetches every comment GitHub knows about the PR (issue comments,
   inline review comments, review bodies) via the three REST endpoints
   wrapped in ``github_ops.fetch_pr_comments``.
2. **Filters those comments before the AI ever sees them.** Only
   comments whose author is in the trusted allowlist
   (``review_response.trusted_reviewers`` in config, unioned with
   ``--reviewer`` flags) survive. Optionally narrows further with
   ``--since <iso>``. Empty allowlist → the command refuses to run.
3. Renders a prompt embedding only the surviving comments, inside
   clearly-delimited blocks — so the AI is reading structured data, not
   live PR context.
4. Checks out the PR's head branch locally and invokes Claude, reusing
   the streaming / cost / error-retry machinery from :mod:`ai_resolve`.
5. Verifies the resolver kept history **linear** (new commits only, no
   rewrites) before pushing: HEAD must be a descendant of the pre-run
   tip. Anything else aborts without pushing.
6. Plain (non-force) push — races are a user problem, we refuse to
   clobber someone else's work.

Deliberately stateless: the PR does not need to be tracked in the
project's state file. Re-running is the user's call; there is no
"already-addressed" bookkeeping. Pair with ``--since`` when you want
incremental behaviour.

Injection-safe by construction: every piece of text Claude sees is
either (a) configuration / CLI input you control, or (b) the body of a
comment authored by someone you listed as trusted. Untrusted comments
are dropped at fetch time, before the prompt is rendered.
