"""``releasy import`` — rebuild ``state.yaml`` from GitHub.

State never leaves a local ``state.yaml`` on disk (it's gitignored), so
a fresh clone / new teammate / throwaway CI runner starts with nothing.
Everything RelEasy actually *needs* to keep running (source PRs,
rebase PRs, mergeability) is discoverable from GitHub, and the fields
that aren't (``Skipped`` decisions, cumulative ``AI Cost``) live on the
configured GitHub Project board. This module stitches those two reads
together into a local ``state.yaml`` + ``STATUS.md``.

Scope (deliberately narrow):

1. Read-only: no git checkouts, no clones, no pushes, no new PRs. The
   command relies entirely on the GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs.
2. Requires a GitHub Project to be configured
   (``notifications.github_project``). That's the only place
   ``Skipped`` + ``AI Cost`` are durable — without it we can't honour
   the "board is source of truth for those" contract.
3. Merges into existing local state instead of clobbering it: local
   fields survive unless the board has a newer/authoritative value
   (currently just ``status: skipped`` and ``ai_cost_usd``), and local-
   only signals that don't exist on GitHub at all (``ai_iterations``,
   ``failed_step_index``, ``partial_pr_count``, ``conflict_files``) are
   preserved verbatim.

What the command does NOT try to recover:

* Branches pushed under ``pr_sources.auto_pr: false`` that never had a
  PR opened — we'd have no way to identify them without cloning. Users
  who hit this can re-run ``releasy run`` (idempotent) to reopen them.
* Mid-flight ``failed_step_index`` / ``partial_pr_count`` — these only
  make sense during a live cherry-pick; re-running the pipeline would
  produce a different (and more accurate) failure mode anyway.
