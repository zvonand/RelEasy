"""Pipeline state management — read/write per-project state files.

State no longer lives in the user's repo dir. Each project (identified
by ``Config.name``) gets its own state file under
``state_root() / "<name>.state.yaml"`` (XDG state location by default,
overridable via ``$RELEASY_STATE_DIR``).

The state file additionally carries the absolute ``config_path`` of the
config that owns it, so we can:

  * surface a friendly listing in ``releasy list``,
  * detect "wait, this state belongs to a different config.yaml"
    collisions when somebody copies a config without changing ``name:``.

Use :func:`verify_ownership` before mutating; use :func:`adopt_ownership`
to forcibly rebind state to the current config (the ``releasy adopt``
command).
