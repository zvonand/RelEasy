"""Auto-discover a PR dependency DAG and emit a recommended grouping.

The ``releasy discover-deps`` command:

1. Walks the candidate PR set defined by ``config.pr_sources``, treating
   each user-declared group as a single super-node.
2. Excludes units already merged into the target branch (state.yaml +
   ``Source-PR:`` trailers + ``git cherry``).
3. Trial-cherry-picks each remaining unit onto the target tip in a
   scratch git worktree (``git worktree add --detach``).
4. On a clean pick, emits the unit as a leaf in the DAG.
5. On conflict, looks up older un-ported units that touched the
   conflicting files (via ``git log target..source -- <file>`` mapped
   through merge-commit / Source-PR: trailer / merge-containment rules),
   then optionally hands the candidates to Claude to confirm.
6. After all units are processed, computes weakly-connected components
   → the recommended groups, with articulation points called out as
   ``recommend_first``.

The command is read-only: it never writes ``state.yaml`` and never
touches the main worktree. By default it also writes a deps overlay
to ``<session-stem>.deps.yaml`` next to the session file (override via
``pr_sources.deps_file:`` in the session) — the session loader merges
that file's ``groups[]`` into ``pr_sources.groups`` on the next
``releasy run``. Pass ``--no-write`` to skip the overlay write
(preview mode), or ``--deps-file <path>`` to redirect it to a one-off
path. The main session file is never modified.

    """For each candidate PR's merge_commit_sha, ask ``git cherry`` whether
    every commit the PR introduced has a patch-id equivalent in target.

    Implementation note (was a bug, now fixed):

    ``git cherry <upstream> <head>`` walks ``<upstream>..<head>`` —
    EVERY non-merge commit between the merge-base and ``<head>``. For a
    PR's merge commit on master, that's typically *hundreds* of master
    commits, including unrelated PRs the user may have cherry-picked
    into target. Marking the candidate PR as "already in target"
    because *any* of those master commits had a patch-id match is
    wrong — that's what produced false positives where PRs that were
    never ported showed up under ``skipped_already_in_target``.

    Two scoping changes:

    1. Constrain the walk to the PR's *own* commits via the
       ``<limit>`` argument: ``git cherry <target> <head> <limit>``
       walks ``<limit>..<head>`` only.
       * For a true merge commit (2+ parents), ``<limit>`` is
         ``parents[0]`` and ``<head>`` is ``parents[1]`` — the PR
         branch's own commits.
       * For a single-parent commit (squash-merged PR — and rebase-
         merged PRs whose ``merge_commit_sha`` happens to be the last
         commit), ``<limit>`` is ``<sha>~1``. For squashes this
         walks exactly the squash commit; for rebase-merged PRs with
         multiple commits this is an under-approximation (we only
         check the last one), which is a deliberate trade-off:
         missing a true positive (false negative) is far less harmful
         than mistakenly skipping a PR that needs porting.

    2. Require *every* line in the constrained output to start with
       ``- `` (patch-id match) before marking the PR as already-in-
       target. The previous "any match" policy was the actual source
       of false positives even after scoping is corrected.

    Cross-repo / unfetched merge SHAs are skipped silently via the
